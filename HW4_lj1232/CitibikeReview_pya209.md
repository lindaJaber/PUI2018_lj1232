# Citibike Review


## Question posed: Do people of different age groups use CitiBike the same?


## Analysis of Hypotheses: 

Linda has taken 2 age groups to compare, i.e. **Generation X** (born between 1965 and 1980), and **Millenials** (born between 1981 and 1996).

Her Null hypothesis states: 
>The proportion of Generation X using CitiBike is the same as that of Millenials in a given month.

Her Alternate hypothesis states:
>The proportion of Generation X using CitiBike is different from that of Millenials in a given month.

>### $H_0$ : $\frac{G_{\mathrm{1}}}{G_{\mathrm{total}}} = \frac{G_{\mathrm{2}}}{G_{\mathrm{total}}}$

>### $H_a$ : $\frac{G_{\mathrm{1}}}{G_{\mathrm{total}}} \neq \frac{G_{\mathrm{2}}}{G_{\mathrm{total}}}$
