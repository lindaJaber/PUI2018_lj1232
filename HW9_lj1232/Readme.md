## Brief:

### Assignment 1:
I reviewed my classmates plots. It was fun!  
uploaded a copy in my repo as well as there's through forking and sending a pull request.(please note that one of myy classmates didn't respond to my pull request yet.)

### Assignment 2:
I practiced regression models using statsmodels package

### Assignment 3:
The aim behind this assignment was to investigate the relationship between fire arms possession and the number of mass shootings.  
We were asked to plot a lot of variables as part of the expploartory data analysis.  
Then we ran regression models from different packages and saw different possible fits.
All of the fits are positively linearly correlated however the measured r-squared was low, so we questioned how much the models can precisely predict the data.
