## Review:
Clarity: The plot is clear, however the intention behind plotting it is vague. It would have been more informative to plot the distribution of dog ownership with respect to another variable e.g. proximity to parks, average living space per person in a zip code, or average income in a zip code as an indicator of wealth. Another way to make the plot more interesting is to describe the zip codes that show a very high and a very low number of dogsâ€™ licenses and try to explain what is unique in these zip codes that would affect our variable significantly.

Esthetic: The color scheme is proper and the intended differences in dog licenses number can be noticed when comparing dark and light areas on the map.  However, using a different scheme (e.g. equal intervals) and limiting the number of interval (e.g. k=5) would make the plot easier to read.

Honesty: I do not see any intention to manipulate the data.

Choropleth of the number of dog licenses issued in 2016 by zipcode. The darker the area, the higher the number of dog licenses issued to owners residing in the zipcodes.
