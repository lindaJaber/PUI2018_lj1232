**The figure above is a map of Lebanon showing the boundaries of Cazas or Districts.
The locations of informal syrian refugee settlements are plotted on the map.

The locations are color coded by the availability of free vaccines for children under 12 years old,
where dark circles indicate unavailability. We notice that a significant number of settlements lacking vaccination.**
