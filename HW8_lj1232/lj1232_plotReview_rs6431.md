Hi Linda,
Good Job!

**Here is the plot:**
![alt text](../HW8_lj1232/Syrian_Refugee_Settlements_in_Lebanon.jpeg)

The figure above is a map of Lebanon showing the boundaries of Cazas or Districts. The locations of informal syrian refugee settlements are plotted on the map. This shows us how the settlements are concentrated in the east districts of the country as well as in those in the north. The locations are color coded by the availability of free vaccines for children under 12 years old, where dark circles indicate unavailability. We notice that a significant number of settlements lacking vaccination.


**Here is my review**:

This plot is easy to read with suitable size, clear title, label and legend. The colors of points clearly indicate the binary variable (No Free Vaccination/ Has Free Vaccination ), under the white geographic background and black edge, this grough is compelling. In addtion, the author wrote a detailed  caption, which provides a good explaination of the graph as well as helps readers to understand. This plot also has social value, indicating that the government and other countries may need to put more efforts to help those people. Overall, it is an excellent plot. Thank you for your hard-working!
